# Anonymity on [Mapknitter](https://mapknitter.org)

[Publiclab](https://publiclab.org) is an organization dedicated to protecting the planet by building useful [tools](https://github.com/publiclab) and bringing together passionate and kind people who want to have a positive impact. Mapknitter is at the beginning of this collaboration between committed individuals when it was used to [provide public information about the 2010 BP Oil Disaster](https://publiclab.org/wiki/stories). Mapknitter has since grown and now hosts **2761** maps but still upholds its fundamental idea of sharing **open** data that anyone can **contribute to or edit**. This mission is why the ability to contribute anonymously is important for Mapknitter. Users should not be bogged down with privacy issues and the extra barrier of creating an account as they advance this admirable initiative.
